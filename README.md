Remember:</br>
● You should improve your code compared to the past exercise applied to
ESPN web application. Include the best practices topics given.
● Avoid using implicit waits, they end up creating idle times in the test executions.
Be sure to use Page Object Pattern, Assertions (you decide how to validate each of
the flows), and Parameters.
● Use Assertions to assert test steps
Example: When I finish the Log Out account, I will assert the “account was
canceled” message appears.
● Remember the difference between when to use Parameters and Data
Providers. For example, you can use Parameters to set the URL of the
webpage you’ll be testing.
